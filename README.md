If you go into the bin/release directory you’ll find a series of folders named after various Elliott languages and apps.  In each of these you’ll find filed with names like DEMO3.DAT.

So run in release mode, then

    CD folder
    DO DEMOx

should run a demo for you.

The 903ALGOL folder is probably the most interesting. Some of the later demos pop up windows to represent line printer and graph plotter output.

(As I’m doing this from memory you might have to poke around a bit to find the demo folders...)
